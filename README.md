## About the Video Course
In this course, we have taken a unique approach by making it super-friendly and accessible for a complete beginner by defining a daily curriculum with hands-on practice each day. Each day covers specific aspects of programming in Python for 30 minutes, followed by a practical exercise that you can perform as homework by implementing what you learned for approx. an hour. The next day begins with a brief recap of the exercise and then we move on to the next aspect of the course.
